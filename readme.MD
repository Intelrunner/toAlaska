[title]To Alaska
[subtitle] A Game of Steps

## Summary

'To Alaska' is a text and partial graphic game about the journey of you - also known as the Survivor - from a random starting point to the final destination (Anchorage, Alaska). Along the way, you have to manage 3 crucial components:
1. **Energy**: You begin with 100 energy points, and you can increase to 200, or decrease to 0 from there. 0 energy = death. There is no  'are you sure you want to do this' if you are about take an action that will drop your energy below 0. You will just die and be forced to respawn. over the course of your life.

2. **Steps to Anchorage**: This is how far you have left to your end goal. It's measured in steps because, well - you spend a lot of time walking. 

3. **Inventory**: The stuff you have with you. This can be weapons, junk, important items, etc. You really won't be able to tell what you can use something for until you are in a situation with it.
