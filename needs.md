## Summary
This is a brief summary of what is needed for **To Alaska** to reach various stages of development and playability. It is non-automated and not tied in to any sort of CICD process. Merges to this file will be made manually.

### Stage 0: Concept-Alpha
1. This is the first stage of development. We have nothing but lists of what we don't have. None of the core frameworks, functionality, or services are built, integrated, or ready for testing. We are just starting out.

2. Build the core framework which will handle the creation, manipulation and update of the following resouces and records: 
- the Player
- the Map
- the Inventory
- the Objects
- the Actions

**1a.** The Player Resource
- [Player documention with further technical specs is here](player/player-resource.md)
- [ ] Create Player codebase
- [ ] Create Player database and connections, etc 
- [ ] Create API for Player to interact with other APIs
- [ ] Create Web Views and Templates
