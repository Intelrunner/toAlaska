# To Alaska: The Player Resource

## Summary
The Player Resouce is the term used to encompass all of the functions anc classes that are used to create and manage the Player and it's interaction with the other APIs in the codebase, and in turn will be the main (maybe only) way the player themselves interact with the rest of the game. 

This won't always conform to 'best practices' at first - or maybe ever; but I doubt the first 'production' code for most mass produced games will be as good as they get starting in version 0.idea.
